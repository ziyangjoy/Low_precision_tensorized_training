## Setup

Each example has a separate requirements file to avoid unnecessary extra installs for the smaller problems (MNIST,NLP).

The directories `mnist` `nlp` and `dlrm` contain MAP implementations (no sampling for variational inference) of our method and instructions to run the examples. 

The directory `tensor_layers` has the python package for the tensorized layers.
